### How to combine FluentValidation with i18n 

The i18n is designed to replace the use og .NET reesources in favor of an **easier**, globally, recognized standard for localizing ASP.NET web applications. 
FluentValidation offer more flexibility in defining rules and can even be used with IoC to inject configuration objects to determine which rules to run while also supporting client side validation. 

This project is a result from my experience with getting FluentValidation and i18n to play together nicely. There are some pitfalls that wil be highligheted.
